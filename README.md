# BCI- Brain Computer Interface

This project is a compartitive study of different ML algorithms to find out the best sutiable Algorithm for BCI.

Brain-Computer Interface is a system that allows users to interact with the computer, where the device predicts the abstract aspects of cognitive state with brain signals such as Electroencephalography (EEG).
