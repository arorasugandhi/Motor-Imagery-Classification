# BCI- Brain Computer Interface

This project is a compartitive study of different ML algorithms to find out the best sutiable Algorithm for BCI.

Brain-Computer Interface is a system that allows users to interact with the computer, where the device predicts the abstract aspects of cognitive state with brain signals such as Electroencephalography (EEG).

# Objective of this Project:-
* To overcome the pathological shortcomings of the human body, such as neuromuscular disorders, through technology.
* Helping motor deficit patients by using the neuroplastic through BCI.
* I have taken the approach of utilizing deep learning algorithms in order to attempt to reduce time delay caused by software or algorithms.


For this project I did a wide literature review and shortlisted three algorithms namely Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boost Classifier.
These algorithms were shortlisted based on their previous result, easy-to-use code, less inference time.
